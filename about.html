    <h1>When I'm not helping teams be productive while maintaing a healthy work-life balance, I'm doing the following things.
        </h1>
        <h2>Soccer</h2>

            <p>I love playing soccer since i was a teenager. at fiirst i used to be a goalkeeper but later discover i have dribblig skills. So i changed from keeping to mid fielder. my favorite numbers on the field are 6, 8, and 10. with this i drible , tackle and at times scores too. i also enjoy playing numbers 7 at the right wing of the field</p>
        <h2>Cook</h2>

            <p>Apart from soccer, i love cooking too especially my local dishes. i learned cooking from my mom when i was young. Since then i have lose any of the talents, i keep on gaining more skils for cooking.This has really helped me alot with saving money spent for restaurants on foods or fast foods. Cooking at times is challenging but the more efforts you put in, the more likely you gonna like to cook. </p>
        <h2>Mentor</h2>
        <img src="Mentor.webp" width="200">
            <p>dating back to my secondary School days i was very good with science, i usually past almost all my tests. This made most of my teachers to appoint me as the mentor to my classmates .In the process of mentoring i also benefited alot of skills because the areas i don't know, i would be force to work harder inorder to know so i can explain to my class mates. i also gained skills of addressing people or group or population.</p>
