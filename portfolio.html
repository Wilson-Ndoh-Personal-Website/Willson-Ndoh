    <h1>Things I've built, in no particular order</h1>
    <h2>The First Project</h2>
    <img src="Food rep.jpg"width="200">
    <p>With the hyper-convenience of modern life, many of us can now operate an electric multi-cooker. Enjoying a home-cooked and delicious meal is now luxury. THis saves time and comes with flexibility. I for one do must of my french fries in the airfryer. i also do love to use the slow cooker for rice boiling and not forgeting the pressure cooker i normally use for hard stuff that won't get ready early such as beans and beef.</p>
    <h2>The SEcond Project</h2>
    <img src="Forecast.webp" width="200">
    <p>This is a Weather forecasting system project. In this project, a combination of science and technology isuse to make accurate predictions on weather conditions of a particular location at a particular time. Parameters use for forecasting are pressure, temperature, humidity, speed, wind just to name a few. This weather forecasting project is a web application</p>
    <h2>The third Project</h2>
    <img src="Fingerprint.jpg" width="200">
    <p>In this project, we developed a fingerprin base voting application that can recognise users based on their fingerprint patterns. Since fingerprint  authentication is unique for each person, the system can quickly identify the voters using their fingerprints. Naturally, a voter can vote just once. The Admin adds all the names and photos of the norminated candidates. The admin then authenticates users by verifying their identity proof, and after verification the voter is registerd in the system</p>
